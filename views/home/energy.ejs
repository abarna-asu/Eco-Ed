    <h3>Powering Through the Heat: Managing Energy Consumption in Arizona</h3>    
<p>Arizona is a large state with a warm and arid climate, leading to high demand for energy to power air conditioning units and other cooling systems. In 2019, the state consumed 97.4 billion kWh of electricity, with the residential sector accounting for the majority of consumption at 39%. Commercial and industrial sectors also played a significant role in energy consumption, with commercial buildings using about 25% of the state's electricity and industrial facilities using about 24%. 
    
    Arizona has significant potential for renewable energy, particularly solar power, and as of 2021, about 6.2% of the state's electricity generation came from solar power. The state has set a goal to generate 15% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. To promote energy efficiency, Arizona has implemented a number of programs, including rebates for energy-efficient appliances and weatherization assistance for low-income households, which have helped to reduce overall energy consumption in the state.</p>
<h3>Tempe's Energy: From Natural Gas to Solar Power, Keeping Cool in the Arizona Heat</h3>
    <p>The Tableau visualization provides a detailed breakdown of energy consumption in Tempe, Arizona by sector and fuel type. One interesting fact that can be gleaned from the visualization is that the residential sector accounts for the largest share of energy consumption in Tempe, followed by the commercial and industrial sectors. Additionally, natural gas is the most commonly used fuel source across all sectors in Tempe, followed by electricity.

    Another interesting fact from the visualization is that the transportation sector accounts for a relatively small share of energy consumption in Tempe, despite the fact that the city is home to Arizona State University, one of the largest universities in the country. This may be due in part to the city's relatively compact size and efficient public transportation system, which includes a light rail system and a network of bus routes.</p>
<blockquote>Natural gas is the most commonly used fuel source across all sectors in Tempe </blockquote>
<p>The industrial sector accounts for a relatively small share of energy consumption in Tempe compared to the rest of the state. In Arizona as a whole, the industrial sector uses about 24% of the state's electricity, whereas in Tempe, the sector accounts for only about 12% of energy consumption.

    Natural gas is the most commonly used fuel source across all sectors in Tempe, but the transportation sector relies almost exclusively on gasoline and diesel fuel. This highlights the ongoing challenge of reducing emissions from the transportation sector, which is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.
    
    The use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is relatively small in Tempe, accounting for only about 1% of energy consumption across all sectors. However, the city has set a goal of sourcing 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035, so it will be interesting to see how this evolves over time.
    
    Finally, the visualization shows that energy consumption in Tempe tends to peak in the summer months, which is not surprising given the hot Arizona climate. This underscores the importance of energy efficiency measures and the need for residents and businesses to conserve energy during peak demand periods.</p>

    <h3>Mesa's Energy: From Solar Power to Natural Gas, Sustaining the Heat in the Desert</h3>
    <p>The visualization shows that energy consumption in Mesa tends to peak in the summer months, much like in Tempe. This underscores the importance of energy efficiency measures and the need for residents and businesses to conserve energy during peak demand periods.The residential sector is the largest consumer of energy in Mesa, accounting for about 43% of total consumption. The commercial sector comes in second at around 27%, while the industrial sector uses about 24% of the city's energy.
    </p>
    <tableau-viz id="tableauViz1" src='https://public.tableau.com/views/EnergyConsumption_16811607266080/MESASustainableEnergy?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link' height='500px' width='1000px' toolbar='bottom' hide-tabs>
    </tableau-viz>
    <p>
        Like Tempe, natural gas is the most commonly used fuel source across all sectors in Mesa, followed by electricity. However, Mesa uses a higher percentage of natural gas (about 70%) than Tempe does (about 60%).
        
        The use of renewable energy sources like solar power is more prevalent in Mesa than in Tempe, accounting for about 8% of energy consumption across all sectors. This is likely due in part to the fact that Mesa is home to the largest solar power plant in Arizona, the Solana Generating Station.
        
        The transportation sector is a relatively small consumer of energy in Mesa, accounting for only about 3% of total consumption. This is likely due to the fact that Mesa is a relatively small city compared to other metropolitan areas in the United States, and many residents commute by carpooling or using public transportation.
        
        Finally, the visualization shows that energy consumption in Mesa tends to peak in the summer months, much like in Tempe. This underscores the importance of energy efficiency measures and the need for residents and businesses to conserve energy during peak demand periods.</p>
<h3>Fueling Mesa: Understanding Natural Gas Consumption</h3>
<p>the United States is the world's largest consumer of natural gas, accounting for about 20% of global consumption. In 2020, the United States consumed about 31 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is more than twice as much as Russia, the world's second-largest consumer of natural gas. </p>
